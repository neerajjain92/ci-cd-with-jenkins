# CI-CD with Jenkins 

This is the playground for setting up CI-CD pipeline with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/) and deploy on [Pivotal Web Services](https://console.run.pivotal.io/)

We are leveraging [ngrok - secure introspectable tunnels to localhost](https://ngrok.com/) to publish webhook events running on local jenkins.
